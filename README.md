### Status: üöß In progress

SpyChat is still in under development, and some features are not yet implemented. I will continue to maintain this project

* You have to apply for appid„ÄÅapiSecret„ÄÅapiKey at the [xun fei open platform][xfyun], and put them into local.properties.
    ex:
    appId="123456"
    apiSecret="abcdefghijkopqrstuvwxyz"

* You need allow RECORD_AUDIO permission in settings, since the runtime permission feature have not done.
