## Known issues
* You have to apply for appid„ÄÅapiSecret„ÄÅapiKey at the [xun fei open platform][xfyun], and put them into **local.properties**
* example:
    appId="123456"
    apiSecret="abcdefghijkopqrstuvwxyz"
    apiKey="abcdefghijkopqrstuvwxyz"
* You need allow RECORD_AUDIO permission in settings, since the runtime permission feature have not done.

## Base sample
